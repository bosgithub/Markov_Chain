# Markov_Chain

Introduction of Markov Chain Notebook:

Introduces markov chain with an example of two companies competing in the same market. We introduce the idea of initial state of the market and transition probability matrix. Example also has code that produces the state after we run multiple iterations of transition, eventually, we end up at a state which the marketshare no longer changes, this steady state is refered to as stationary matrix.

Regular Markov Chain Notebook:
Discusses the properties of regular Markov Chain and a new application example with solution.
