# Markov_Chain

### Introduction of Markov Chain Notebook:

Introduces markov chain with an example of two companies competing in the same market. We introduce the idea of initial state of the market and transition probability matrix. Example also has code that produces the state after we run multiple iterations of transition, eventually, we end up at a state which the marketshare no longer changes, this steady state is refered to as stationary matrix.

### Regular Markov Chain Notebook:

Discusses the properties of regular Markov Chain, mainly, how we will always arrive at the limiting stationary matrix, we also discuss an public transit application example with solution.

---

### Absorbing Markov Chain Notebook:

Discusses the properties of absorbing Markov Chain, unlike the regular Markov Chain, in absorbing Markov Chain, we will encounter a state, once entered it is impossible to leave, the absorbing state. We also have some graphical example of absorbing Markov Chain. In addition, the standard form of absorbing Markov Chain is shown.
